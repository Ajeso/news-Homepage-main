## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

when I started this challenge my goal was to practice and use Sass for the first time and I must say I chose the right challenge for this.
Here are some of the things that I learnt.

This links your generated and compiled css to the html since you can not have .scss extension for the link

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="scss/style.css" />
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to master JavaScript so this challenges I'm taking they help me increase my HTML and Css knowledge whilst learning JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM&t=1289s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This helped me with Sass I really liked this tutorial and will use it going forward.
